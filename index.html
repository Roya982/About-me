            <p class="intro">I would like to introduce my self to you friends</p>
            <p class="intro">My name is Roya Alakayleh and I'm 23 years old</p>
            <p class="intro">I've graduated from AL AL Bayt uni in Almafraq-Jordan with MLS bachelor degree, but you see I'v spent 5 months after graduation jop hunting, and had zero luck. It was depressing time, spending this much time without doing something meaningful related to the field of my study, and that where it started to change. My friend told me about a programming scholarship that I sign for and was accepted in then I started this new field in life.</p>
            <p class="intro">I'm a passionate person who hopes one day to leave a mark that will help to improve the world and wont be deleted no matter what.</p>
            <p class="intro">I've been interested in programming since 10 or so years, but when my interest was in it's peak, it wasn't that acceptable in the society so I dropped the idea and navigated my interest to the medical field, and that's what got me into the MLS mess. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to change my major or something, after all the medical field have always been a childhood dream. I'm a part of ASAC to merge those two fields together, come up with a new thing no one came up with before and make my dream come true, but you know? lets forget about all this poring things and let me till you about the things I love </p>

            <p id="hobbies">you see, I've always had a lot of hobbies, so I'm a malty-talented person, I can draw, write in both Arabic and English languages, poetry reading, acting and a lot more. I don't know if it was sad or not, but I stopped doing most of those since 4 or 5 years by now. If you're curious to read what wrote up till now you can visit me on:</p>
